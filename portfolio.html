                needs them to do his AP World History homework.</p>

                <h5 class = "margin">Scoring System:</h5>

                increases</p>

              <h5 class = "margin">Game End:</h5>

              <h4 class = "margin">Reflection</h4>
              <h5 class = "margin">Why did you make the game you created? What was the inspiration?</h5>
              <p class = "margin">I made this game because I was obligated to. I was inspired to use Maplestory graphics because they look cool and I had no idea what
                else to use that would look better and I made a boss fight because it seemed to be the easiest thing to do at the time.</p>

              <p class = "margin">The Health Bar system I wanted to use didn't like my Scratch game and I didn't like it either so I removed it. I wasn't able to do all
                the fancy things I wanted to do and solved this by "I didn't".</p>
                <hr>
              <h5 class = "margin">If you had more time or resources, what aspects of the game would you change or improve?</h5>
              <p class = "margin">If I had more time, I would improve the title screen and the boss fight, so basically everything.</p>
              <hr>
              <h5 class = "margin">This is an important algorithm</h5>
              <p class = "margin">This algorithm is used to animate the player walking towards the left side of the screen by checking the current costume, transitioning
                to the costumes looped in the animation, checks when the player stops walking, and transitions back to the default costume.</p>
